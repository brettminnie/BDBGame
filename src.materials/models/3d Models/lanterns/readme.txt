[One of the lanterns used in "Chicago Nights", (c) 1999-2000 by ttt]

 This package contains the following files:
   
      lanterns.zip
           \strassenlaterne.3dt  -  Road Lantern with spot- and foglight
           \strassenlaterne1.3dt -  Same thing, but lighting improved
                                    and a corona added
           \lantern.jpg          -  Screenshot of "strassenlaterne1.3dt"
           \readme.txt           -  this File


Just put the *.3dt Files into the "objects" folder in G3D directory (create
when not existing)
With the "lib"-Dropdownmenu at the "Template"-Dialogue select object you want
and press Enter. Press the "Quick Compile" Button to view the lantern in
the upper left preview window.
Feel free to use this model in your games; I would be happy about you sending me
a mail, or noticing me in the credits.
