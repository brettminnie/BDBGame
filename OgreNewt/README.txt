-----------------------------------

NEW IN THIS VERSION:
1) updated library now includes some fixes, and Raycasting classes.
2) big update to demos!  now a total of 5 demo programs, including joints, raycasting, material callbacks, and vehicles.



This is a library that connects Ogre (www.ogre3d.org) with the Newton Game Dynamics physics engine (www.newtondynamics.com).

feel free to use this code however you wish.  please let me know if you find it useful / or have any comments.


unzip this alongside your "ogrenew" directory.  to compile correctly, it also assumes you have the Newton SDK installed in another
directory alongside this one called "NewtonSDK".

for example something like this:

c:/programming/ogrenew				<- ogre installation
c:/programming/OgreNewt/OgreNewt/readme.txt  	<- this file
c:/programming/NewtonSDK			<- Newton SDK.




have fun!
